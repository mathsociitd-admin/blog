>### *Does P equals NP? after “how humans evolved” this is the biggest ques , Darwin of which is yet to be discovered.*

_**Hey!**_ fabulous moment you took a stop at this one :tada: :tada: .as maybe after this 5min read , your life and consequently world may change in a positive way! Not only I am tempting your dollar liking nerves to win 1million dollars from Clay institute but if you cracked just P=NP then:
* Cancer diseases will be gone forever , databases ,scheduling , transportation systems will work at never before achievable speed and,
* the biggest bait of all is that you can crack 10700 levels of Candy Crush with ease :P and can be the **Universe boss**.
* This doesn’t end here , there are literally more spellbinding tasks which can bring an absolutely updated version of Earth. I am extremely sorry if your business entirely depends on crypto-related algorithms as , if somehow someone someday shows P=NP , then whole subject of cryptography has to be altered. Though we may  have to dig for new privacy-keeping algos but I think it would be still be worth it IF P=NP.

 Lets dig a bit deeper into this. P is a class of problems which human race has solved quickly and efficiently ,by being “efficient” I mean algorithms of these problems can compute in polynomial time ("polynomial time" implies that relation between time taken by computer and input size is a polynomial, also note P for *polynomial*),  while there’s another class , the infamous NP problems, solutions of which humans can verify “efficiently”(same efficient as one before) but can't devise quick methods to solve, that is time that existing algorithms take eventually break the patience , of not only humans but also of Universe.For instance say , Sudoku , we can very easily verify quickly if all the rules hold true in a given sudoku puzzle but apparently we can't propose a algorithm that can solve any random puzzle in seconds.Actually NP was thought of much bigger class of problems some time ago and is currently divided into two subclasses. One of them consist of problems that some enthugeeks just like readers of blog get motivated and solved efficiently. While the bigger fish is NP-Complete problems which were initialized half a century ago by Stephen Cook , and none of which have been solved yet. Even if one problem is solved in polynomial time among these NP-Complete(also known as co-NP) problems then it can be said NP=P.Also do note , we are absolutely sure that P is contained in NP , as problems getting solved in polynomial time also indicates that solutions can be verified in polynomial time.Broadly speaking we have four options available to tick :

  Bitterly typing , most of the theoritical Computer Scientists believe that NP doesn’t equals P. Delightfully typing , they haven’t got a proof of this statement :P.
 Let's look into some of the best attempts to prove P ~~equals~~ NP of history. 
 * Razborov's "almost" Robust attempt
    * It has been proved that small circuits cannot solve the parity function if the circuits have
a fixed number of layers of gates. Razborov
showed the NP-complete problem of finding a large clique
does not have small circuits if one only allows AND and OR
gates (no NOT gates). If one extends Razborov’s result to
general circuits one will have proved P!=NP , however later Roborov himself diagress with previous results if NOT gate is also taken into consideration.

* Daring Diagonalisation
    * This famous technique in mathematics was first used by Cantor to prove real numbers are uncountable.Turing, in his seminal paper on computation , used a similar technique to show that the Halting problem is not computable.Therfore ,theoritical experts tried this approach in an attempt to separate NP from P , some of them even some fruitful results but weren't able to satisfactorily prove P ~~equals~~ NP.
    
Not to break "blog" rules and simultaneously to give direction to your enthusiasm , reader can visit https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1911/1911.00722.pdf that contains Razborov's attempt in more detail , and http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.841/spring09/scribe/lect02.pdf describes diagnolisation in depth.
