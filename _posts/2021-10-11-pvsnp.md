>### *Does P equals NP? after “how humans evolved” this is the biggest ques , Darwin of which is yet to be discovered.*

Welcome. Take a seat. We have been awaiting your arrival for quite a long time. We are presenting you with an opportunity of a lifetime, an opportunity that may completely change your life. Not only are we tempting your inner avarice by providing you with a chance to win a million dollars from the Clay Mathematics Institute, but also letting you know that if you solve this problem:

>* Cancer diseases will be gone forever,
>* Databases, scheduling, transportation systems will work at >never before achievable speeds and,
>* the biggest bait of all is that you can crack 10700 levels >of Candy Crush with ease and can become the **Universe boss**.
>* This doesn’t end here, there are literally more spellbinding tasks which can bring an absolutely updated version of Earth. I am extremely sorry if your business entirely depends on crypto-related algorithms as, if somehow someone someday shows P=NP, then whole subject of cryptography has to be altered. Though we may  have to dig for new privacy-keeping algos but I think it would be still be worth it IF P=NP.

 Let's dig a bit deeper into this. P is a class of problems which human race has solved quickly and efficiently; by being “efficient” I mean algorithms of these problems can compute in polynomial time ('polynomial time' implies that relation between time taken by computer and input size is a polynomial, also note P for *polynomial*), while there’s another class, the infamous NP problems, solutions of which humans can verify “efficiently”(same efficient as one before) but can't devise quick methods to solve, that is time that existing algorithms take eventually break the patience, of not only humans but also of Universe. For instance, say Sudoku, we can very easily verify quickly if all the rules hold true in a given Sudoku puzzle but apparently, we can't propose an algorithm that can solve any random puzzle in seconds. Actually NP was thought of much bigger class of problems some time ago and is currently divided into two subclasses. One of them consists of problems that some enthusiastic geeks, just like readers of blog, get motivated and solved efficiently. While the bigger fish is NP-Complete problems which were initialized half a century ago by Stephen Cook, and none of which have been solved yet. Even if one problem is solved in polynomial time among these NP-Complete(also known as co-NP) problems, then it can be said NP=P. Also, do note, we are absolutely sure that P is contained in NP, as problems getting solved in polynomial time also indicate that solutions can be verified in polynomial time. Broadly speaking, we have four options available to consider :

  Bitterly saying, most of the theoritical Computer Scientists believe that NP doesn’t equals P. Delightfully typing, they haven’t got a proof of this statement.
 Let's look into some of the best attempts to prove P$\ne$NP of history. 
 * <h5>Razborov's "almost" Robust attempt</h5>
    * It has been proved that small circuits cannot solve the parity function if the circuits have a fixed number of layers of gates. Razborov showed the NP-complete problem of finding a large clique that does not have small circuits if one only allows AND and OR gates (no NOT gates). If one extends Razborov’s result to general circuits, one would have proved P doesn't equals NP, however later, Roborov himself disagrees with previous results if NOT gate is also taken into consideration.

* <h5>Daring Diagonalisation</h5>
    * This famous technique in mathematics was first used by Cantor to prove real numbers are uncountable. Turing, in his seminal paper on computation, used a similar technique to show that the Halting problem is not computable. Therefore, theoretical experts tried this approach in an attempt to separate NP from P; some of them even some fruitful results but weren't able to satisfactorily prove P doesn't equals NP.
